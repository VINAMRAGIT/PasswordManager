# PasswordManager
This is a rudimentary Password Manager, constructed with the help of the JDK 20, as well as JFX 20. The manager utilizes symmetric AES encryption to be able to securely enrypted private data and store it in order to be able to retrieve it for further use later on. 
Data parsing, decryption, and encryption is done with the use of the crypto package within Java, and the usage of cyphers is common with the manager's source code. Layering on top of the manager is the GUI, created with the help of the Gluon Scene Builder, and additional FXML files. 
Controller classes are used to mesh the Graphical elements with the functionality of the manager, with controllers initializing new scenes depending on the stage the manager is in. The manager allows for decryption and viewing of data, adding and removal of elements, as well as data persistence for further viewing after multiple sessions. 
This project displays efficient use of various advanced functional development strategies in Java, such as the use of lambdas, method references, Optionals, and a number of Collector methods, implemented to organize the decrypted data. Many higher level classes from Java were also used, such as Collections, Streams, DataTime, and Application.
